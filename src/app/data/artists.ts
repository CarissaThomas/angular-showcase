      name: 'Art Of Hot',
      bio: "Chris Demetras, AKA Art Of Hot, is a seasoned, west coast dance mixes producer and DJ. Art Of Hot has produced almost 170 original tracks and remixes on over 30 labels.  Prolific DJs such as Carl Cox , Jon Rundell and Angel Alanis have played out his material.  Chris began DJing in 1992 and within a few years began producing.  He then decided to perform live under the name Art Of Hot.  Art of Hot caught the dance music bug in the heady and lively San Francisco club/rave scene of the early ‘90s. Doc Martin, Garth, Jeno, The Hardkiss Brothers and DJ Dan have a profound influence on his taste and mixes. Art of Hot spent time digging records beside Doc Martin in the beloved, and sadly missed, BPM record store on Polk street.  His breakthrough track was released on Looq Records and subsequently licensed to Microsoft XBox’s Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 2 compilation in 2004. In 2010 Chris moved to Portland, Oregon and continued craft.  Art Of Hot’s track with Franck Valat, “Goodwill,” appeared on the compilation Minimal Club Affairs Volume 4, released on legendary German dance label ZYX.  Tech house isn’t the only style in which Chris is fluent, he is also extremely adept at creating drum ‘n’ bass, electro, bass mixes and breaks. Now, firmly based in Portland, Chris and partner Jim Collier throw the popular monthly party Flight.",

        name: "Pocho's Cosas",
        bio: `Jim Collier, otherwise known as Pocho’s Cosas, has been a photographer since 2012. Though Jim’s father was from the U.S., his mother was from Mexico and was greatly influenced by her culture. While he was
        growing up in California, his mother enrolled him in a Mexican folk dancing group where his classmates
        teased him about being too Americanized. “Pocho”, is what they called him, which translates as “watereddown Mexican”. The word “cosas” can be translated as “stuff” or “things”….hence, “Pocho’s Cosas”. Jim
        obviously has a good sense of humor about the nickname and grew to embrace it as a way to describe his
        art. He’s deeply influenced by traditional Mexican art but intertwines it with the spectacular appears of
        performers on the stage. The colors that the lights create makes for a beautiful photograph and Jim
        knows just how to capture it for the viewer.
        Jim also incorporates the equipment that performers use to showcase the entire presence of the performer
        in action. His other work is creating the insides of shrine boxes, which are obviously also influenced by
        traditional Mexican art. He’s fascinated by the connections between how cultures blend with each other
        and adopt similar ideals in their development as well as their aesthetics. “There’s an apparent crosscultural situation happening,” he says, when asked to describe his artwork. Both personally and
        professionally he’s adaptable and can find something in common with anyone which makes him a relatable
        person to be around. He loves hearing about people’s cultural backgrounds and where they’re from and is
        able to connect with anyone in any environment.
        Pocho’s Cosas is inspired by pop-culture artists such as Alejandro Jodorowsky, John Waters and Pierre et
        Gilles. His partner also inspires him, pushing him to grow as an artist and offering support not only
        personally but professionally as well. He’s now at the point where he’s wanting to move his work beyond
        the club scene and capture other life events as well still art living solely off of his craft. Photography is
        something that makes him feel good and is getting more recognition for his talent. Years ago, Jim was in
        an accident that left him physically disabled but photography has acted as a healing agent that has given
        him the ability to express himself. He has a talent for capturing “art in the moment” and is nothing short
        of a true expressionist, taking hold of the aesthetics and personalities that he sees through the lens."`,
